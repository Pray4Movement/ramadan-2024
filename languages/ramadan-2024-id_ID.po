#~ "\n"
#~ "Women typically spend the afternoons preparing a big meal. At sunset, "

#~ "the fast with a drink of water, then three dried date fruits, and a multi-"

#~ "Though many have stopped fasting in recent years, and are turned off by "

#~ "\n"
#~ "     Wanita biasanya menghabiskan sore hari untuk menyiapkan makanan "
